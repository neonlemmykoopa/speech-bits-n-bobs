# speech-bits-n-bobs
A series of random python scripts which I have written for various tasks, mostly in speech research and feature processing.

## convert2wav.py
Batch convert a folder of audio files into 16kHz monaural wav files (for use with many different speech/audio processing toolkits).  This script can also be used as a framework for performing other batch tasks on a folder of files.

## prune_csv.py
A script which takes a csv file and a list of headers, and removes any headers in the csv file which aren't part of the list of headers.

## hobson_io.py
A cpntinuously updated script containing various i/o functions which I find myself reusing frequently.
